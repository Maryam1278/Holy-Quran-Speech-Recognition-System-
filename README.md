# Holy-Quran-Speech-Recognition-System-
This project uses deep learning to classify Quranic recitations as correct or incorrect. The model was trained using LSTM architecture on features extracted from audio recordings, including MFCCs, delta, delta-delta, chroma, spectral contrast, tonnetz, zero-crossing rate and spectral bandwidth. It was developed using Python, TensorFlow, Keras for model training, FastAPI for the backend, and Flutter for the frontend interface. The dataset consists of labeled Quranic verse recitations. The goal is to help users improve their Quran recitation by providing feedback.
